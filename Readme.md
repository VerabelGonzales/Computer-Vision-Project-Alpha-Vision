### Introduction
It is known that 54.9% of Bolivian households in urban areas have at least one dog as a pet, according to an article published by [Fides](https://www.noticiasfides.com/economia/mas-de-la-mitad-de-los-hogares-en-bolivia-tiene-un-perro-126400 "Fides") news agency. The percentage of canine population in Bolivia is growing by 20% each year being registered in 2019 2.2 million dogs; this information is extracted from an article by the newspaper [La Razon](https://www.la-razon.com/lr-article/la-poblacion-de-perros-en-bolivia-aumenta-20-por-ano-2/#:~:text=En%20Bolivia%2C%20la%20poblaci%C3%B3n%20canina,seg%C3%BAn%20el%20Ministerio%20de%20Salud. "La Razon").  This is important information to intuit that in Bolivia there is a huge number of pets, however, many of these are lost, although there is no exact data of how many dogs are lost in Bolivia, we can make a comparison with a neighboring country like Peru, which records 400,000 dogs lost per year, according to an article published by [Andina.pe](https://andina.pe/agencia/noticia-unas-420000-mascotas-se-pierden-cada-ano-peru-falta-identificacion-732435.aspx#:~:text=Unas%20420%2C000%20mascotas%2C%20entre%20perros,que%20es%20muy%20dif%C3%ADcil%20identificarlas. "Andina.pe"), this shows that it is a latent problem. We intend to help by computer vision to find dogs. The problem is initially faced with the classification of breeds and color of a given dog, this will be achieved with two artificial intelligence models trained with the YOLO Method, the classification of breeds is delimited 30 breeds (the most common in Bolivia). Once the breed and color are determined, we label them with these characteristics and perform the search of this in the Dataset that corresponds to its label, for this we will use feature extraction methods such as SURT, SITF, ORB in addition to a preprocessing to these images to obtain better results. For the acquisition of images we use the Kaggle platform which is an online community of data scientists, in this platform you can collect a lot of data for different projects, within the platform you can see different sources of information, It was decided to choose [Dog Images ](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yaswanthgali/dog-images "Dog Images ")as the optimal option for this particular case because it contains labeled folders of 110 dog breeds all with different characteristics, each folder consists of approximately 170 images, this Dataset will help a more effective training for the detection of breeds for the previously mentioned, this is important because it is the first step for us to meet our goal. To evaluate the results obtained by the algorithm, some measures of accuracy are used when working with object detection, the best known is MAP (mean average precision) which consists of four evaluations, precision, recall, IOU (Intersection Over Union) and AP (average precision), these metrics will give us information about the performance of our algorithm.
